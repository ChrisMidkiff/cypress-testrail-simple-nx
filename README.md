## Debugging

This tool uses [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug#readme) to output verbose logs. To see the logs, run it with environment variable `DEBUG=cypress-testrail-simple`.

## Why?

Because [cypress-testrail-reporter](https://github.com/Vivify-Ideas/cypress-testrail-reporter) is broken in a variety of ways and does not let me open issues to report the problems.
